# Claude Inventory Manager

**A scope-aware inventory manager for Claude Code customizations — view, organize, and sync your memories, skills, MCP servers, hooks, commands, and plugins.**

## Problem

Claude Code customizations (memories, skills, MCP servers, hooks, etc.) are scattered across multiple directories with ugly encoded paths. Users don't know:
- What customizations they have
- Which scope each one applies to
- Whether something is in the wrong scope
- How parent-child scope inheritance works

## Solution

A lightweight web dashboard + MCP server that:
1. Scans all Claude Code customizations
2. Displays them in a scope-aware hierarchy
3. Lets users drag-and-drop items between scopes
4. Syncs changes to git for versioning

## Competitive Landscape (researched 2026-03-18)

### Direct Competitors

| Tool | Type | Scope View | Move Between Scopes | Threat |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [drewipson/claude-code-config](https://github.com/drewipson/claude-code-config) | VS Code ext (pre-release v0.1.2) | ✅ Tree view | ✅ Right-click move | ⚠️ Medium |
| [conradBruchmann/claude-admin](https://github.com/conradBruchmann/claude-admin) | Web dashboard (v0.1.9, Feb 2026) | Partial | ❌ | Low |
| [joeyism/claude-code-config](https://github.com/joeyism/claude-code-config) | TUI | MCP only | ✅ MCP only | Low |
| [Claude Deck](https://claudedeck.org/) | Web dashboard (React+FastAPI) | ❌ | ❌ | Low |
| [claude-code-backup](https://github.com/Ranteck/claude-code-backup) | Backup scripts | ❌ | ❌ | None |
| [ocodista/claude-dashboard](https://github.com/ocodista/claude-dashboard) | Read-only HTML | ❌ | ❌ | None |

### Key Competitor Analysis

**drewipson/claude-code-config** — closest competitor:
- VS Code extension with tree view of memories, skills, hooks, permissions
- Right-click to move items between global and project scope
- **Gaps vs us:** VS Code only (not standalone), no drag-and-drop, no MCP servers, no scope hierarchy visualization, pre-release quality, no web UI

**conradBruchmann/claude-admin** — broadest feature set:
- Web dashboard covering skills, memory, MCP, agents, plugins, sessions, analytics
- Shipped Feb 20, 2026 — growing fast (33 commits, v0.1.9)
- **Gaps vs us:** No scope hierarchy view, no move between scopes, no drag-and-drop. Config editor, not inventory manager

### What Nobody Has Built (our lane)

No existing tool combines all three:
1. **Unified scope hierarchy** — all item types (memories, skills, MCP, hooks) organized by Global → workspace → project
2. **Move between scopes** via drag-and-drop or modal UI
3. **Standalone web dashboard** — not tied to VS Code or any IDE

### Anthropic Official Stance (researched 2026-03-18)

- `/config` is a per-scope settings toggle, NOT a cross-scope inventory
- No changelog entries, planned issues, or blog posts mention config dashboard / inventory
- Official plugin `claude-md-management` focuses on CLAUDE.md content quality, not scope management
- 2026 Anthropic focus: plugins ecosystem, remote control, scheduled tasks, auto memory, 1M context
- **Risk of Anthropic building this: LOW** — no signals in any channel

**Our unique angles:**
- Scope-aware hierarchy with drag-and-drop (nobody has this)
- Zero dependencies (single Node.js file + SortableJS CDN)
- Daily git versioning (track what changed over time)
- Cross-machine diff and export/import
- Standalone — works anywhere, not locked to VS Code

## Target User

Any Claude Code power user who has accumulated enough memories, skills, and configs that they need to organize and understand their setup.

## Architecture

### What We Manage

| Type | Has Sub-types | Has Scope | Can Move Scope | Storage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | feedback / user / project / reference | Global, per-project | Yes — between memory folders | `.md` files with frontmatter |
| **Skills** | No | Global (`~/.claude/skills/`), per-repo (`.claude/skills/`) | Yes — between skill folders | Folders with `SKILL.md` |
| **MCP Servers** | No | Global (`.mcp.json`), workspace, per-repo | Yes — move JSON entry between `.mcp.json` files |
| **Hooks** | By event type (Stop, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.) | Global, per-project, per-repo | Yes — move between `settings.json` files |
| **Commands** | No | Per-repo (`.claude/commands/`) | Yes — between command folders |
| **Plugins** | No | Global | No — installed globally only |
| **Config** | No | Global + per-project | No — locked, edit via Claude or manually |
| **Plans** | No | Global (`~/.claude/plans/`) | No — ephemeral |
| **Agents** | No | Per-repo (`.claude/agents/`) | Yes — between agent folders |
| **CLAUDE.md** | No | Global + per-repo | No — locked, edit manually |

### Scope Hierarchy

```
🌐 Global                         ← applies everywhere
  ↳ 📂 AlltrueAi (workspace)      ← applies when cd ~/AlltrueAi/*
      ↳ 📂 ai-security-control-plane (project)
      ↳ 📂 ai-security-ui (project)
      ↳ 📂 rule-processor (project)
  ↳ 📂 MyGithub (project)         ← applies when cd ~/MyGithub
  ↳ 📂 Documents (project)        ← applies when cd ~/Documents
```

Child scopes inherit parent scope's memories, skills, and MCP servers.

### Move Safety Rules

- Memory → only to other memory folders
- Skill → only to other skill locations (global or per-repo)
- MCP → only between `.mcp.json` files
- Config/CLAUDE.md/Plans → locked, cannot move
- Every drag-and-drop shows a confirmation modal before executing
- Moves happen in real `~/.claude/` paths (not just the backup repo)

### Tech Stack

- **Server**: Single Node.js file (zero npm dependencies, built-in modules only)
- **Client**: HTML + CSS + [SortableJS](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) via CDN (13KB)
- **Distribution**: MCP server + npm package (`npx @mcpware/claude-inventory`)
- **Also works as**: standalone `localhost` dashboard

### Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|:------:|-------|
| **Ubuntu / Linux** | ✅ Supported | Primary development and testing platform |
| **macOS** | ⚠️ Untested | `~/.claude/` path should work, needs verification |
| **Windows** | ❌ Not yet | Path handling needs adaptation (`C:\Users\...\.claude\`) |
| **WSL** | ⚠️ Untested | Should work like Linux, needs verification |

Current limitation: developed and tested on Ubuntu only. macOS and Windows support planned for future release.

**Cross-platform notes (researched 2026-03-18):**
- macOS: `~/.claude/` same as Linux, `os.homedir()` works → should work out of the box
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\`, but path encoding uses `--` for `:\` (known Claude Code bug [#14403](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14403))
- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var can override config location — should check this first
- `fs.rename` needs `EXDEV` fallback (copy+delete) for cross-filesystem moves

## UI Design

### Design Principles
- Light theme, clean, minimal
- Hierarchy: Scope headers (most prominent) > Category bars (medium) > Item rows (subtle)
- All light backgrounds with dark text
- Items indented under categories, categories indented under scopes
- Same-type icons: all memories use 🧠, all skills use ⚡, all MCP use 🔌, all scopes use 📂

### Current Mockup
See `mockup.html` — interactive prototype with:
- Collapsible scope/category sections
- SortableJS drag-and-drop (memory↔memory, skill↔skill, mcp↔mcp only)
- Drag confirmation modal
- Detail panel on click
- Search and filter pills
- Scope inheritance indicators (`↳ Inherits 🌐 Global 📂 AlltrueAi`)
