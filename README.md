## The Problem

Two things happen silently every time you use Claude Code — and neither one is visible to you.

### Problem 1: Where you put things matters — and Claude puts them in the wrong place

Claude Code has a scope hierarchy: **Global → Workspace → Project**. Anything in Global loads into every session on your machine. Anything in a Project scope only loads when you're in that directory. Where a memory, skill, or MCP server sits determines which sessions it affects.

The problem: **Claude doesn't care about scope when it creates things.** It dumps everything into whatever scope matches your current directory. Over time, this turns into a mess:

**Skills in the wrong scope affect the wrong projects:**
- You build a deploy skill while working in your backend repo. It lands in that project's scope. But you want it everywhere — it should be in Global. Without moving it, your other projects can't see it. You end up creating another one in other projects.
- A Python-specific testing skill sitting in Global gets loaded into every React frontend session. It wastes tokens and confuses Claude with irrelevant instructions.

**Memories pile up and duplicate:**
- You tell Claude "always use ESM imports" while inside a project. That memory is trapped in that project scope — your other projects don't get it.
- My experience: Claude created 3 separate memories about Slack updates, all saying the same thing. Each one loads every session.

**MCP servers silently reinstall across scopes:**

![Duplicate MCP Servers](docs/reloaded%20mcp%20form%20diff%20scope.png)

Teams installed twice, Gmail three times, Playwright three times. You configured them in one scope, Claude reinstalled them in another. Each duplicate loads independently.

**You can manage this with CLI commands or by asking Claude** — `ls` one directory, `cat` each file, ask Claude to move this here, delete that, show me what's in this scope. But you're spending turns and tokens just to understand the layout, one item at a time, before you can even decide what to do with it. There's no single view that shows you the full picture: all items, all scopes, all inheritance, at once.

### Problem 2: You have no idea how much context is already used

All of this wrong-scope and duplicate config has a cost. This is a real project directory after two weeks of use:

![Context Budget](docs/cptoken.png)

**~29K tokens immediately loaded into context, with another ~112K deferred for MCP tools.** On a 200K window, that's ~14% gone before you type — and grows as Claude selectively loads tools during the session. The fuller the context, the less accurate Claude becomes (**context rot**).

And these numbers only cover what we can measure offline. During a session, Claude silently adds more: rule files re-injected after every tool call, file change diffs, and your full conversation history resent on every API call.

### The fix: a visual config manager

```bash
npx @mcpware/claude-code-organizer
```

Think of it like a file manager for `~/.claude/`. You can do everything in terminal too — but sometimes you need to see the whole tree to understand what's going on.

The workflow: see what's loaded and where it comes from → spot duplicates and wrong-scope items → drag-and-drop to the right scope or delete → check Context Budget → refresh → repeat until your initial load is lean.

> **First run auto-installs a `/cco` skill** — after that, just type `/cco` in any Claude Code session to open the dashboard.

### Example: Move a skill to the right scope

You built a `deploy` skill while working in `~/myapp`. It ended up in that project's scope — only visible when you're in `~/myapp`. But it should be Global so all your projects can use it. Open the dashboard, find the skill, drag it from Project to Global. **Done. One drag.** Now every project on your machine can use it.

### Example: See what a project actually inherits

You open a deeply nested project and Claude is behaving weirdly — following instructions you don't remember setting. Click the project in the dashboard. You see its own items, plus everything inherited from parent scopes: workspace-level memories, global skills, MCP servers from two levels up. Now you know exactly what's influencing Claude in this directory.

### Example: Find and clean up duplicates

Claude created the same memory in 3 scopes. An MCP server got installed in both Global and your project. Switch to **By Category** view — all items of the same type across all scopes grouped together. Duplicates jump out immediately. Preview each one, decide which to keep, delete the rest.

- **Tested** — E2E test suite covering scanner accuracy, context budget calculations, filesystem verification, security, and all 11 categories


## Quick Start

### Option 1: npx (no install needed)

```bash
npx @mcpware/claude-code-organizer
```

### Option 2: Global install

```bash
npm install -g @mcpware/claude-code-organizer
claude-code-organizer
```

### Option 3: Ask Claude

Paste this into Claude Code:

> Run `npx @mcpware/claude-code-organizer` — it's a dashboard for managing all Claude Code resources. Tell me the URL when it's ready.

Opens a dashboard at `http://localhost:3847` that works directly with your real `~/.claude/` directory. Next time, just type `/cco` in Claude Code to reopen.

## What It Manages

| Type | View | Move | Delete | Scanned at |
|------|:----:|:----:|:------:|:----------:|
| Memories (feedback, user, project, reference) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Global + Project |
| Skills (with bundle detection) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Global + Project |
| MCP Servers | Yes | Yes | Yes | Global + Project |
| Commands (slash commands) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Global + Project |
| Agents (subagents) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Global + Project |
| Rules (project constraints) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Global + Project |
| Plans | Yes | Yes | Yes | Global + Project |
| Sessions | Yes | — | Yes | Project only |
| Config (CLAUDE.md, settings.json) | Yes | Locked | — | Global + Project |
| Hooks | Yes | Locked | — | Global + Project |
| Plugins | Yes | Locked | — | Global only |

## Scope Hierarchy

```
Global                       <- applies everywhere
  Company (workspace)        <- applies to all sub-projects
    CompanyRepo1             <- project-specific
    CompanyRepo2             <- project-specific
  SideProjects (project)     <- independent project
  Documents (project)        <- independent project
```

Child scopes inherit parent scope's memories, skills, MCP servers, commands, agents, and rules.

## How It Works

1. **Scans** `~/.claude/` — discovers all projects, memories, skills, MCP servers, commands, agents, rules, hooks, plugins, plans, and sessions
2. **Resolves scope hierarchy** — determines parent-child relationships from filesystem paths
3. **Renders dashboard** — three-panel layout: sidebar scope tree, category-grouped items, detail panel with content preview
4. **Handles moves** — drag or click "Move to...", moves files on disk with safety checks, undo support
5. **Handles deletes** — delete with undo, bulk delete, session cleanup

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status |
|----------|:------:|
| Ubuntu / Linux | Supported |
| macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) | Supported (community-tested on Sequoia M3) |
| Windows 11 | Supported (community-tested, VS Code extension) |
| WSL | Supported |

## Project Structure

```
src/
  scanner.mjs       # Scans ~/.claude/ — 11 categories, pure data, no side effects
  mover.mjs         # Moves/deletes files between scopes — safety checks + undo support
  server.mjs        # HTTP server — REST API + context budget engine
  tokenizer.mjs     # Token counting (ai-tokenizer ~99.8% accuracy, bytes/4 fallback)
  mcp-server.mjs    # MCP server — 4 tools for AI clients (scan, move, delete, destinations)
  ui/
    index.html       # Three-panel layout with resizable dividers
    style.css        # All styling (edit freely, won't break logic)
    app.js           # Frontend: drag-drop, search, filters, bulk ops, undo, session preview
bin/
  cli.mjs            # Entry point (--mcp flag for MCP server mode)
```

Frontend and backend are fully separated. Edit `src/ui/` files to change the look without touching any logic.
